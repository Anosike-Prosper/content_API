# 3.1 Article Recommendation System

This project implements a **personalized article recommendation engine** based on user **interests** and **interactions** (views/likes).  

The logic ensures that users always see relevant content whether or not they have provided interests or interacted with articles.

---

## üîé Recommendation Logic

The recommendation system follows **3 main cases**:

### **Case 1: User has defined interests**
- When a user registers, they may provide one or more interests (e.g., `football`, `golf`, `cooking`).
- Articles are recommended if their **tags/categories** match **any** of the user‚Äôs interests.
- If the user has multiple interests, the query checks against all of them (`$in` in MongoDB).
- Example:  
  - User interests = `["football", "cooking"]`  
  - Recommended articles = Articles tagged with **football** OR **cooking**.

---

### **Case 2: User has no interests but has interactions**
- If the user hasn‚Äôt set interests but has **viewed or liked articles**, their history is used.
- The system recommends **popular articles** (sorted by likes/views) that the user has **not already interacted with**.
- This avoids showing duplicate content while still keeping recommendations relevant.

---

### **Case 3: User has no interests and no interactions**
- For completely new users (no interests and no interactions):
  - The system recommends **globally popular articles**, based on overall likes/views.
- This ensures new users always see trending or highly engaging content.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Interaction Recording

- **Views**: Each view is stored as a separate record (a user may view the same article multiple times).  
- **Likes**: A user can only like an article **once**. Attempting to like the same article again returns an error.  

This design provides flexibility for analytics (tracking multiple views) while maintaining logical constraints for likes.

---

## üöÄ Benefits of this Approach

- **Personalized** ‚Üí Users with interests get tailored recommendations.  
- **Adaptive** ‚Üí If no interests are set, past interactions guide recommendations.  
- **Fair for new users** ‚Üí Falls back to popular content so nobody sees an empty feed.

# 4. Submission Guidelines

### Content Recommendation API

A **Node.js + TypeScript** API for managing users, articles, interactions, and generating personalized article recommendations using **OpenAI embeddings**.  
The system stores content in **MongoDB** and provides REST endpoints for CRUD operations and recommendations.  

---

### üöÄ Features
- User management with interests.  
- Article management with embeddings stored in MongoDB.  
- Track user interactions (likes, views, etc.).  
- Personalized recommendations using **content-based filtering** and vector similarity.  
- Pagination support for fetching articles.  

---

### üì¶ Technology Stack
- **Node.js / Express** ‚Üí Backend framework for APIs.  
- **TypeScript** ‚Üí Static typing for better maintainability.  
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** ‚Üí Database and ORM for managing users, articles, and interactions.  
- **OpenAI** ‚Üí Used to generate embeddings for articles and match content relevance.  
- **dotenv** ‚Üí Environment configuration.

## Technical Choices

- Express ‚Üí Simple and widely adopted for REST APIs.

- TypeScript ‚Üí Adds strong typing and reduces runtime bugs.

- MongoDB (Mongoose) ‚Üí Handles flexible document storage for users, articles, and interactions.

- OpenAI Embeddings ‚Üí Enables semantic similarity for better content recommendations.

- express-validator ‚Üí Ensures request inputs are valid and clean.

## üß© Stretch Goal: Recommendation Logic

For recommendations, I implemented a hybrid content-based approach:

1. Each article is stored with a vector embedding.

2. When fetching recommendations:

- User‚Äôs interests are matched with article metadata.

- User‚Äôs past interactions (e.g., likes) are compared with embeddings using cosine similarity.

- Results are combined and ranked before returning.

This ensures personalized results that adapt as the user interacts more.

# What I Would Do Next

If I had more time, I would add:

- Authentication & Authorization (JWT-based).

- Unit & Integration Tests (Jest / Supertest).

- Advanced Error Handling with standardized error responses.
